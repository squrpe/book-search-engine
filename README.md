# Book Search Engine 

  ## Description
  This starter code of this project was a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and I was tasked to refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

  However, many issues were faced when trying to start both the server and client. Even after going through the project with a tutor, each edited file was deemed normal but still, trying any backend functionality caused an 'invalid token' error.
